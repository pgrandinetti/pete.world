      <description>Hi, Pete here. Lifelong learning and outdoor sport is what I do.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big fan of blogs until I realized that I needed one. I write here, though, primarily for me. To be sure, I am happy if I can help somebody else too, but the writing is for me. I need to see what&amp;rsquo;s that I actually know, and to put concepts in writing is the best way to really understand what things I did, what I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and what I missed because I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know about them.</description>
