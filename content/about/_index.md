Hi, Pete here. Lifelong learning and outdoor sport is what I do.

I wasn't a big fan of blogs until I realized that I needed one. I write here, though, primarily for me. To be sure, I am happy if I can help somebody else too, but the writing is for me. I need to see what's that I actually know, and to put concepts in writing is the best way to really understand what things I did, what I didn't, and what I missed because I didn't even know about them.

Depending on your passions in life, some of my writings can be interesting for you too. The covered subjects range from education and learning, long-term traveling, to freelancing and endurance sport.

I keep a file with a bunch of famous quotes that I try to remember and use as guides. One I like is _All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone_ (B. Pascal).

I am a fan of silence. I believe focus, silence and motivation are the ingredients needed to move forward. Silence is where great questions are asked. I am puzzled about why people spend so much time immersed in noisy low quality content.

I am not easy to reach. For reasons obvious to those who read this far on the page, you won't find me in social networks. Your best bet is LinkedIn. Good luck.

Keep learning!
