Hi, Pete here. Lifelong learning and outdoor sport is what I do.

I wasn't a big fan of blogs until I realized that I needed one. I write here, though, primarily for me. I will often address "you" in an essay, but it's actually directed to myself, for the next time I'll read it.

Depending on your passions in life, some of my writings can be interesting for you too. The covered subjects range from education and learning, long-term traveling, to freelancing and endurance sport, to (seldomly) engineering.

## Favorite quote

It often changes. I have a file with a bunch of famous quotes that I try to remember and use as guides. My current favorite is

> _All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone._ --B. Pascal

I am a big fan of silence. I am puzzled about why people spend so much time immersed in noisy low quality content when there are so many interesting things to learn.

## Contact

I am not easy to reach. For reasons obvious to those who read this far on the page, you won't find me in social networks. Your best bet is LinkedIn. Good luck.

Keep learning!
